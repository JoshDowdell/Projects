The files contained in this repository were used as a part of my semester project in Advanced Heat Transfer at Memorial University of Newfoundland. 

This project was largely an exploratory project on my part, as I had not had much exposure to numerical techniques (beyond simple examples in classes) or programming in Python. Because of this, I'm sure there are more elegant or efficient ways to obtain the same results; this was mainly for me to get a basic understanding.

The programs start out with the most basic case of a single extended surface, also called a fin. The fin's temperature profile and heat flow are obtained numerically. This is expanded for the case of the single stack finned array, which is essentially a base fin with two fins attached at its tip. The temperature profiles and heat flows are also obtained by using a hybrid analytical/numerical technique. Finally, the behaviors of a double stack finned array are obtained. This can be visualized as a single stack attached to another single stack. 

If anyone has any tips or ideas for improving the numerical analysis I'd love to hear them.
